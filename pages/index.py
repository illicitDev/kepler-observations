            ## Kepler Exoplanet Search Results

            I used measurements from the Kepler Space Telescope to build a model that can accurately predict whether 
            exoplanets are present around stars in our region of the milky way.
            
            This model can help us better understand our local region of the galaxy, as well as provide a window into the 
            possibilities of life in the universe.
            
            I will use two models: a Gradient Boosted Tree, as well as a Multinomial 
            Logistic Regression, to classify an observation as 'CONFIRMED', 'CANDIDATE', or 'FALSE POSITIVE'.
